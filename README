Due to many requests I share my zsh configuration compilation.
Copy the repository to ~/.zsh and run 'make install' once
(or link the ~/.zsh/zshrc manually to ~/.zshrc)

### File description
~/.zsh/README      - This file
~/.zsh/Makefile    - make-config to run with 'make install'
~/.zsh/aliases     - alias definitions which can be edited/modified with 'aedit'
~/.zsh/completion  - tab completion configuration
~/.zsh/functions   - functions and key bindings to that functions
~/.zsh/options     - shell options as history size, general keyindings, etc
~/.zsh/prompt      - the prompt definition
~/.zsh/zshrc       - the main RC file (will be linked to ~/.zshrc)

### These files are not in the repository but will be created
~/.zsh/history     - the history file (shared for all zsh instances)
~/.zsh/private     - private commands/aliases etc. (included at the end)
                     this should also include definitions for
                     EDITOR, PAGER, cdpath, fpath etc.
